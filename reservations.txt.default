# Make a copy of this file and rename it to "reservations.txt"
# Add times and dates to fit your needs

# The format for a day and time is as follows:
# weekday startTime endTime AM/PM location

# A list of valid locations: HTRC, CRWC

# An example of the formatting:
# Monday 8 - 9:30 PM HTRC

# The order of the days does not matter, however the formatting needs to be
# correct, otherwise the program will not work
