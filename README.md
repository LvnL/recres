# RecRes
This is a `Python3` based project that automatically reserves a gym slot with the University of Iowa's Recreational Services
## Installation
- Clone the repository (SSH is most convenient in my experience)
- Ensure you have the latest version of `Python3` installed
## Operation
- Run `python3 recres.py` to start the script (using Linux's `screen` command is recommended to have easy access to the running instance at a later point in time)
